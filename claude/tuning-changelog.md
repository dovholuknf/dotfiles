# Tuning changelog

Shit clint has done to try to make claude suck less. A running log of directive, hook, and config changes
aimed at how claude behaves. Newest first. One dated line per change, plus a short why.

## 2026

- **2026-08-19** Installed a `Terse Engineer` output style (fetched from CLBRITTON2/windows-dev), real file in
  `claude/output-styles/`, symlinked into `~/.claude/output-styles/`. Testing whether an output style is a
  cleaner home for the terse/no-filler register than the CLAUDE.md chat directives.

- **2026-08-18** Added a CMake-preset guard to the pre-tool-use hook: blocks bare `cmake --build` / bare
  configure in any repo that has presets, forcing `--preset`. Why: a bare cmake reconfigures with the shell
  env, drops `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` and the shared installed dir, and rebuilds every vcpkg port from source
  into the wrong cache. Cost clint a 13-minute rebuild.

- **2026-08-14** Added a Simplified-Technical-English register to the chat directives (active voice, present
  tense, one meaning per word, short sentences). Goal: tighter, clearer replies. Set as a preference, not a
  hard rule, so meaning is never contorted to obey it.
